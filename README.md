## About
A minimalistic clone of Youtube Music App in which you can enjoy music by Megadeth - one of my favorite metal bands.

The application pulls music data from the open Apple itunes API which pulls the top 50 results for Megadeth. Click on a song and enjoy a preview of 30s (provided by itunes).

With the application you can play/pause a song and play the next & previous songs in the sequence.


## How to Test
Make sure you have the Expo Go app installed. 
For Android - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent
For iOS - https://apps.apple.com/in/app/expo-go/id982107779

Once you install the Expo Go app, run the following commands from a terminal -
```
git clone https://github.com/JatinBumbra/youtube-music-clone.git
```
```
cd youtube-music-clone
```
```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```

Open the Expo Go app, tap on **Scan QR Code** and scan the QR code in the terminal. Voila!
